<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">About 
 Me</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">I lift my lamp beside the golden 
 door.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">I taught English in the Japanese 
 public school system for three years.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In NYC, I have personally taught 
 thousands of people to speak English. The average age of my students was 
 about 25 years old.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Many of the people I have taught 
 are or were undocumented immigrants. They were some of the best people 
 I've ever met. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Some of my students would work 
 a 16-hour shift in a kitchen, get out of work around 7am, and come straight 
 to my ESL class at 8am.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If the culture of your company 
 or organization is anti-immigrant, anti-black, anti-mu</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">I seek to work with smart, creative 
 people who are citizens of the world. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If you prize the American flag 
 over the American Constitution, judge people on the color of their skin 
 rather than the content of their character &#160;-- or, in general, prize 
 form over substance -- please look elsewhere for a technical writer. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">This has included both documented 
 and undocumented immigrants, as well as short-term visitors, visiting 
 university students, etc.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">I'm an American born and raised. 
 &#160;I'm from New York.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">I speak Spanish fluently. &#160;I 
 used to speak Japanese well, but haven't spoken it since 1993.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Team-Building</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">A Word About My Values</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Not like the brazen giant of Greek 
 fame,</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">With conquering limbs astride 
 from land to land;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Here at our sea-washed, sunset 
 gates shall stand</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">A mighty woman with a torch, whose 
 flame</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Is the imprisoned lightning, and 
 her name</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Glows world-wide welcome; her 
 mild eyes command</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The air-bridged harbor that twin 
 cities frame.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&quot;Keep ancient lands, your 
 storied pomp!&quot; cries she</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">With silent lips. &quot;Give me 
 your tired, your poor,</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Your huddled masses yearning to 
 breathe free,</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The wretched refuse of your teeming 
 shore.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost 
 to me,</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">I lift my lamp beside the golden 
 door!&quot;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
