<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Once an order 
 of support has been established in court, the CSEU builds/establishes an account reflecting 
 the amount of the support obligation and the frequency of payments required 
 by the order. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If we have a verified employer 
 address for the NCP, 
 ASSETS will automatically 
 send an IWO to the NCP's 
 employer. IWOs are sent to employers in an automated administrative process 
 that deducts support payments from an NCP's wages or other income, including 
 unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If there is no verified employer 
 address, an IWO cannot be issued. &#160;Instead, a computer-generated 
 billing statement is mailed to the NCP, advising the dates and amounts 
 that scheduled payments are due.</p>
