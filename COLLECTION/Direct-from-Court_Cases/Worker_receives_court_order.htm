<h1 class="Process_Step_H1">Worker receives court order</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The Worker can take information 
 to build the case and account from the court order or from the court interface.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The court order may come to the 
 CSEU on paper, or it 
 may be sent electronically, depending upon local DSS 
 procedures.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The court order alone is not sufficient 
 to build a case, since it does not serve as a request for child support 
 services. To build a case, the CSEU must have a request for services, 
 signed by the applicant, in the form of a petition, 
 addendum, or motion. Without it, there is no request 
 for services, and the CSEU is not authorized to initiate building of a 
 case or account.</p>
