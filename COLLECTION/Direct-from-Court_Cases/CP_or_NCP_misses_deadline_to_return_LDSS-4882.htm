<h1 class="Process_Step_H1">CP or NCP misses deadline to return LDSS-4882</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If the recipient of support fails 
 to return the completed and signed LDSS-4882 
 within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of the Application Cover 
 Letter, the SCU must 
 notify the parties that their case is being closed because the SCU cannot 
 build an account and proceed to provide services without an application 
 for child support enforcement services. &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The SCU must send a letter to 
 the payor of support, with a copy to the recipient of support, to notify 
 the payor to make support payments directly to the recipient of support. 
 Â The SCU must then prepare to close the case under case closure criterion 
 11, Non-Cooperation (refer to <span class="Notices_name">09-ADM-23, issued 
 November 16, 2009</span>, titled <span class="Notices_name">Automated 
 Case Closure</span>).</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Note: &#160;If the completed and 
 signed LDSS-4882 is received after the case has been prepared for closure 
 but prior to the actual closing of the case, the SCU must accept the LDSS-4882 
 and remove the case from the automated case closure process. &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The SCU must then perform the 
 required actions as described under Section V.A.1.b. through Section V.A.1.d., 
 update the case as necessary based on the information provided in the 
 LDSS-4882 and the supporting documentation, and build the account. &#160;Further, 
 the SCU must advise the parties in writing accordingly. &#160;SSDs may 
 develop a local protocol regarding the means used to update the parties 
 in writing.</p>
