<h2 class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">General Safety Concerns: The 
 Safety of the Applicant</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Upon receipt of an <a title="Child Support Application form" 
	 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/HTML/Child_Support_Application-Referral.htm" 
	 target="_blank">LDSS-4882</a>, the CSEU 
 should review the form to determine if the there is an indication that 
 a safety concern exists (refer to Section A – Applicant/Recipient Information, 
 Safety Concerns). </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">As you can see in the screenshot 
 below, the question regarding safety is at the very top of the application 
 form; it is the second question in the entire application.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="text-align: center;"><img src="Safety Concerns - on Application Form.png" alt="" style="border: Solid 1px #000000;" border="1" /></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;If there is no indication 
 of the existence of a safety concern, the CSEU should continue to process 
 the LDSS-4882.</p>

<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; ">If 
 the applicant/recipient checked “Yes” to indicate the existence of a safety 
 concern:</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">The 
 CSEU must discuss the safety concern with the applicant/recipient and 
 determine whether the individual is applying for child support services 
 pursuant to SSL § 111-g 
 (refer to Section C – Application/Affirmation for Child Support Services 
 of the LDSS-4882). &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">If 
 the individual is not applying for child support services pursuant to 
 <span class="Legislation_Titles">SSL § 111-g</span>, the next actions 
 of the CSEU will depend on what services need to be provided and whether 
 the applicant/recipient is being referred from TA, 
 MA, or FC. &#160;The 
 underlying presumption is that the safety concern has developed since 
 the initiation of the referral 
 to the CSEU.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">Specifics 
 regarding safety concerns for individual types of customers (e.g. TA, 
 MA, or FC) can be found in the sections of this Intake chapter devoted 
 to the type of customer in question.</p>
