<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If there is <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> 
 sufficient information available to proceed with the next step of providing 
 child support services, the SCU 
 must build the case using the limited information available for purposes 
 of setting a tickler date. &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The SCU must then send the LDSS-4882 to the recipient of support 
 along with the Application Cover Letter. &#160;The SCU must check the 
 second box on the Application Cover Letter to advise the recipient of 
 support of the actions to be taken in order to obtain child support enforcement 
 services. &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Further, the SCU must provide 
 the payor of support with a copy of the Application Cover Letter. &#160;Finally, 
 the SCU must set a tickler date to serve as a reminder that the recipient 
 of support must return the completed and signed LDSS-4882 within fifteen 
 (15) calendar days from the date of such letter. </p>
