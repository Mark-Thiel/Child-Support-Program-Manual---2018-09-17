<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If a Partial Waiver has been granted, 
 the CSEU will be notified 
 of this by the DVL, via 
 form LDSS-2859.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Under no circumstances can the 
 DVL grant waivers for only <span style="font-style: italic;">some</span> 
 child support enforcement activities and not others (for example, waivers 
 granted for tax offset, but not for driver's license suspension).</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: bold;">If 
 a partial waiver is granted, 
 the CSEU may take the following actions:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Remove the victim's location 
	 or employment information from petitions, notices, or any required 
	 financial disclosure, subject to the approval of the court.;</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px; font-weight: normal;">* 
 While the victim's address can be suppressed from all forms, it is not 
 possible to suppress the <span style="font-style: italic;">name of the 
 county CSEU or the court</span> that issued the order. The victim must 
 be advised of this due to safety concerns.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Request that the court 
	 not disclose the victim's location or employment information;</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Request that the court 
	 order for any laboratory appointments for genetic 
	 testing of the parties and child be done on separate 
	 dates; and</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Avoid calling the victim 
	 to testify at the hearing <?rh-symbol_start name="Em Dash" ?>â€”<?rh-symbol_end ?> 
	 or, if his or her testimony 
	 is required, request that the court make adequate provision for his 
	 or her safety while in court (e.g. testifying by telephone). &#160;A 
	 victim who is receiving temporary assistance is not a necessary party, 
	 and his or her presence or testimony should not be routinely required.</p></li>
