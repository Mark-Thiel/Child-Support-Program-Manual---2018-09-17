<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Full or partial waivers pertain 
 to TA cases only. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">A waiver can exempt a customer 
 in whole or in part from the requirement to cooperate with the CSEU as a condition of receiving temporary 
 assistance.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If a Full 
 Waiver has been granted, the CSEU will be notified of this 
 by the DVL, via form 
 LDSS-2859.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: bold;">If 
 a full waiver has been 
 granted, all enforcement actions must be stopped. &#160;<span style="font-weight: normal;">Any 
 arrears will continue to accrue.</span></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Note that if a full waiver has 
 been granted, but the customer still wishes to pursue an order, they can 
 do so.</p>
