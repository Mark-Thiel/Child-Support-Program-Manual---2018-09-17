<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">Admissible 
 Evidence: &#160;What Is Admissible to Court?</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px; margin-top: 0pt;">Most 
 of the information found during the financial investigation will be hearsay. 
 &#160;Hearsay is inadmissible unless it falls within an exception to the 
 rule.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px; margin-top: 0pt;">Hearsay 
 is: 1) a statement (oral or written); 2) made out of court; 3) that is 
 being offered for the truth of the facts asserted in the statement. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px; margin-top: 0pt;
