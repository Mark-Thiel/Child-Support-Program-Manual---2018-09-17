				 parent’s (NCP’s) specific circumstances. This includes 
				 information acquired during the financial investigation 
				 and considered in determining the amount of imputed income.</p>

				<h3 style="margin-left: 67px;">3. &#160;Impact</h3>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
				 amendments expand the information about new or modified 
				 orders of support to be maintained in the automated case 
				 record to include information about the factual basis 
				 for the support obligation. The amendments also provide 
				 for the creation of a record of the information or documents 
				 obtained as a result of the financial investigation conducted 
				 by the support collection unit or child support enforcement 
				 unit (collectively referred to hereafter as the “CSEU”). 
				 </p>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
				 CSEU may use a checklist of sources of income, assets, 
				 and specific circumstances of the NCP to document and 
				 record information searched and/or obtained as a part 
				 of the financial investigation. The checklist should be 
				 retained in the case records (e.g., the ASSETS Document 
				 Log). A sample checklist/guidance document, the <a title="Financial Investigation Desk Aid" 
				 href="http://sitweb06.otda.state.nyenet/assets/Xexperimental/Program_Manual_Development/FINANCIAL_INVESTIGATION/Financial_Information_Desk_Aid.pdf" 
				 target="_blank">Financial Disclosure Desk Aid</a>, is 
				 available on the Location page of the Electronic Resource 
				 System (ERS). See <span class="Legislation_Titles">17-ADM-11</span>. 
				 </p>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Information 
				 about the factual basis for the support obligation, must 
				 be documented in the remarks of the case records and/or 
				 on a document electronically saved on ASSETS (e.g., Findings 
				 of Fact). In addition, the CSEU must update the Child 
				 Support Standards Act (CSSA) Information record in ASSETS 
				 to include information about the new or modified order. 
				 </p>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
				 CSEU is also required to provide the court with any information 
				 from the case record which may assist the court in making 
				 a factual determination regarding the NCP’s ability to 
				 pay or comply with the order of support. Obtaining and 
				 presenting this information in admissible form may require

				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;"><span

				 support agencies are required to review all available 
				 sources of information and document the sources that were 
				 reviewed, even if unsuccessful in discovering evidence 
				 of a parent’s income or ability to pay. The obligation 
				 should be based on evidence of the NCP’s ability to pay 
				 to the extent there is sufficient information known or 
				 available. In the preamble of the final rule, OCSE expressed 
				 a concern that orders for low-income parents are not based 
				 on the facts of the case but may be based upon a standardized 
				 amount above the means of the parent to pay. </p>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;"><span 
				 class="Legislation_Titles">45 CFR § 303.6(c)(4)</span>. 
				 Child support agencies must establish guidelines for the 
				 use of civil contempt in IV-D cases. These guidelines 
				 must require that the IV-D agency screen the case record 
				 for information regarding the NCP’s ability to pay or 
				 comply with the order. The child support agency must also 
				 provide the court with information regarding the NCP’s 
				 ability to pay, or comply with the order, and his or her 
				 ability to pay the purge amount or comply with the purge 
				 conditions.</p>

				 &#160;Impact</h3>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
				 CSEU must take reasonable steps to determine the NCP’s 
				 income, financial circumstances, and ability to pay support 
				 before commencing a proceeding to establish, modify, or 
				 enforce a support obligation. This does not prevent the 
				 CSEU from investigation or discovery activities after 
				 the proceeding has commenced, especially if the circumstances 
				 or facts (or lack of facts) of the case merit further 
				 action. </p>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
				 regulations require that the CSEU: (i) screen the case 
				 for information regarding the NCP’s ability to pay or 
				 otherwise comply with the order; (ii) utilize other investigation 
				 or discovery methods if appropriate; and iii) provide 
				 the court with information regarding the NCP’s ability 
				 to pay or comply with the order. Providing the information 
				 in admissible form may require the assistance of counsel. 
				 </p>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Determining 
				 what level of financial investigation is appropriate and 
				 reasonable depends on the facts of the case and the parties’ 
				 circumstances. For example, if the NCP has stable employment, 
				 lives within his or her income, and the CP does not indicate 
				 any other sources of income. the mandatory financial disclosure 
				 required by<span class="Legislation_Titles"> FCA 424-a</span> 
				 may be sufficient. If the NCP is self-employed, has expenses 
				 exceeding reported income, or the CP indicates that the 
				 NCP has unreported income or assets, a more searching 
				 inquiry may be needed. </p>
				<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">In 
				 enforcement actions, the CSEU must review the case file 
				 and provide the court with any information from the case 
				 record which may assist the court in making a factual 
				 determination regarding the NCP’s: 1) ability to pay the 
				 support obligation or otherwise comply with the order 
				 of support; or 2) ability to pay a purge amount or comply 
				 with any conditions set in a hearing pursuant to <span
