<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<hr width="50%" align="center" />
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In order to determine the extent 
 of an individual's ability to pay support, and to arrive at a right-sized 
 order, the CSEU initiates an investigation into the PF/NCP's income and 
 other financial resources and assets. &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Even if a PF/NCP fails to appear 
 for a scheduled child support establishment hearing, and a default order 
 is issued, the default order must be based upon the financial realities 
 of the PF/NCP and his/her ability to pay -- and hence, upon a diligent 
 financial investigation of the PF/NCP's financial situation by the CSEU. 
 </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">This is important because setting 
 an obligation amount so high that a PF/NCP cannot make payments serves 
 no purpose, helps no one, and would result in the PF/NCP accruing arrears 
 and facing escalating collection enforcement measures.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<hr width="50%" align="center" />
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: bold;">At 
 a minimum, financial evidence submitted to court in pursuit of a right-sized 
 order should include:</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">WHBR (exists on paper, 
		 and is available via ECS)</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">XXXX</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Any New Hire information/documentation 
		 (New Hires and accompanying information regarding employer and 
		 employee are documented in the ASSETS system itself. So how do 
		 we extract it to present it to the court?</p></li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">On a typical case (where the PF/NCP 
 has one or two jobs, and is not self-employed or in a cash business), 
 a WHBR may suffice as financial evidence. However, prior the court hearing, 
 the worker will look up everything they can in the Advanced Search mode, 
 using the Family Unit Number (FUN, available via the Family Court Interface). 
 Workers search in WRTS and check the CAN &#160;and any DSS case numbers. 
 They also look for any other court activity.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In cases where the PF/NCP is self-employed, 
 works in a cash-only business, or seems to have a standard of living that 
 seems at odds with the PF/NCP's reported income, a more in-depth financial 
 investigation may be warranted.</p>
