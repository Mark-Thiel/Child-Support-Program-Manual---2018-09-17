			 in determining the amount of imputed income.</p>
			<h3 style="margin-left: 67px;">2. &#160;State Regulations:

			 </span>&#160;In any proceeding to establish, modify, or enforce 
			 an order of child support, the child support enforcement unit 
			 shall review the record for information obtained from the 
			 financial investigation conducted on the noncustodial parent 
			 which may assist the court in making a factual determination 
			 regarding the noncustodial parent’s ability to pay child support 
			 in accordance with the standards set forth in <span class="Legislation_Titles">section

			<h3 style="margin-left: 67px;">3. &#160;Impact</h3>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
			 amendments expand the information about new or modified orders 
			 of support to be maintained in the automated case record to 
			 include information about the factual basis for the support 
			 obligation. The amendments also provide for the creation of 
			 a record of the information or documents obtained as a result 
			 of the financial investigation conducted by the support collection 
			 unit or child support enforcement unit (collectively referred 
			 to hereafter as the “CSEU”). </p>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
			 CSEU may use a checklist of sources of income, assets, and 
			 specific circumstances of the NCP to document and record information 
			 searched and/or obtained as a part of the financial investigation. 
			 The checklist should be retained in the case records (e.g., 
			 the ASSETS <a title="Document Log" href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../Screens_You_Will_Encounter_-_Master_List/Document_Log_screen.htm',950,1000);" 
							 id="a51">Document Log</a>). A sample checklist/guidance 
			 document, the <a title="Financial Investigation Desk Aid" 
								 href="http://sitweb06.otda.state.nyenet/assets/Xexperimental/Program_Manual_Development/FINANCIAL_INVESTIGATION/Financial_Information_Desk_Aid.pdf" 
								 target="_blank">Financial Disclosure Desk 
			 Aid</a>, is available on the Location page of the <a title="ERS - Electronic Resource System" 
			 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/" target="_blank">Electronic 
			 Resource System (ERS)</a>. See <span class="Legislation_Titles">17-ADM-11</span>. 
			 </p>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Information 
			 about the factual basis for the support obligation, must be 
			 documented in the remarks of the case records and/or on a 
			 document electronically saved on ASSETS (e.g., Findings of 
			 Fact). In addition, the CSEU must update the Child Support 
			 Standards Act (CSSA) Information record in ASSETS to include 
			 information about the new or modified order. </p>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
			 CSEU is also required to provide the court with any information 
			 from the case record which may assist the court in making 
			 a factual determination regarding the NCP’s ability to pay 
			 or comply with the order of support. Obtaining and presenting 
			 this information in admissible form may require the assistance

			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;"><span 
			 class="Legislation_Titles">45 CFR § 303.4(b)</span> Child 
			 support agencies are required to review all available sources 
			 of information and document the sources that were reviewed, 
			 even if unsuccessful in discovering evidence of a parent’s 
			 income or ability to pay. The obligation should be based on 
			 evidence of the NCP’s ability to pay to the extent there is 
			 sufficient information known or available. In the preamble 
			 of the final rule, OCSE expressed a concern that orders for 
			 low-income parents are not based on the facts of the case 
			 but may be based upon a standardized amount above the means 
			 of the parent to pay. </p>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;"><span 
			 class="Legislation_Titles">45 CFR § 303.6(c)(4)</span>. Child 
			 support agencies must establish guidelines for the use of 
			 civil contempt in IV-D cases. These guidelines must require 
			 that the IV-D agency screen the case record for information 
			 regarding the NCP’s ability to pay or comply with the order. 
			 The child support agency must also provide the court with 
			 information regarding the NCP’s ability to pay, or comply 
			 with the order, and his or her ability to pay the purge amount 
			 or comply with the purge conditions.</p>

			 &#160;Impact</h3>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
			 CSEU must take reasonable steps to determine the NCP’s income, 
			 financial circumstances, and ability to pay support before 
			 commencing a proceeding to establish, modify, or enforce a 
			 support obligation. This does not prevent the CSEU from investigation 
			 or discovery activities after the proceeding has commenced, 
			 especially if the circumstances or facts (or lack of facts) 
			 of the case merit further action. </p>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The 
			 regulations require that the CSEU: (i) screen the case for 
			 information regarding the NCP’s ability to pay or otherwise 
			 comply with the order; (ii) utilize other investigation or 
			 discovery methods if appropriate; and iii) provide the court 
			 with information regarding the NCP’s ability to pay or comply 
			 with the order. Providing the information in admissible form 
			 may require the assistance of counsel. </p>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Determining 
			 what level of financial investigation is appropriate and reasonable 
			 depends on the facts of the case and the parties’ circumstances. 
			 For example, if the NCP has stable employment, lives within 
			 his or her income, and the CP does not indicate any other 
			 sources of income. the mandatory financial disclosure required 
			 by<span class="Legislation_Titles"> FCA 424-a</span> may be 
			 sufficient. If the NCP is self-employed, has expenses exceeding 
			 reported income, or the CP indicates that the NCP has unreported 
			 income or assets, a more searching inquiry may be needed. 
			 </p>
			<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">In 
			 enforcement actions, the CSEU must review the case file and 
			 provide the court with any information from the case record 
			 which may assist the court in making a factual determination 
			 regarding the NCP’s: 1) ability to pay the support obligation 
			 or otherwise comply with the order of support; or 2) ability 
			 to pay a purge amount or comply with any conditions set in 
			 a hearing pursuant to <span class="Legislation_Titles">sections 
			 454 or 455 of the FCA</span>. </p><?rh-droptext_end ?></li>
