<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="text-align: center; color: #ff0000; 
	 margin-top: 5pt; line-height: Normal; margin-bottom: 0pt;">Paternity 
 establishment activities must be initiated as soon as possible</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="text-align: center; color: #ff0000;

 information. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">When a custodial parent is referred 
 to or applies for child support services, workers must determine if paternity 
 has been established. Paternity establishment is the process through which 
 the father of a child born out of wedlock is identified and legally determined.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Paternity establishment is vital 
 to all other functions of the child support program; we can’t go any further 
 without it. If paternity is not established, we aren’t able to pursue 
 a child support order, and therefore, we can’t collect child support payments. 
 </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In the <span style="color: #513077; 
														 font-weight: bold;">Child 
 Support Program</span>, our focus is on legal fatherhood. By understanding 
 the concept of what a “legal father” is and how legal fatherhood is determined, 
 you will be able to confidently assist parents in establishing paternity 
 for their child. You will also be able to help educate both custodial 
 and noncustodial parents on their rights and responsibilities.</p>
