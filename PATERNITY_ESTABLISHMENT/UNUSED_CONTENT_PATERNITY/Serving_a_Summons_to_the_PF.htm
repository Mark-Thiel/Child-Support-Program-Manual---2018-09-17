<h2 style="background-color: #ffff00;">MT - Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">You can serve a summons 
	 at a place of employment (or anywhere else, for that matter). &#160;</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">Therefore, 
 if we don't have a verified address yet, but we have a verified employer, 
 should we proceed with preparing a summons? &#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Is the Paternity Petition 
	 (and supporting documentation) prepared BEFORE serving the summons, 
	 or after?</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Do you need to serve a 
	 summons in order to get a DNA test?</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If so, is another summons 
	 issued after the DNA test comes back positive?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Serving the Summons</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Summonses can be sent through 
 regular (surface) mail, certified mail (for out of state cases), or can 
 be served by a sheriff or process server.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In Non-TA cases, the customer 
 pays for the service.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">When a PF is served a summons 
 for a paternity hearing, copies of the Petition for Paternity and the 
 customer's affidavit are provided to the PF along with the summons.</p>
<h2>What is a Process Server?</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">A process server is a person who 
 delivers a court order and/or documents that compel a defendant’s presence 
 in court. A process server must actually hand these documents to the defendant 
 in the case, and often says, “You have been served.” In instances when 
 it is not possible to hand the documents to the defendant directly, the 
 process server can also give them to management at the defendant’s place 
 of business, or to another adult resident (18 or older) in the defendant’s 
 home, who then becomes the agent of the defendant.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The process server cannot be a 
 party to the particular case mentioned in the documents. The process server 
 must also show proof that the documents were in fact served, and will 
 submit a notarized Affidavit of Service to the court.. In many states, 
 a process server is also required to carry a specific license and in some 
 cases must have insurance as well.</p>
<h2 class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Appearing in Court Remotely <?rh-symbol_start 
	 name="Em Dash" ?>—<?rh-symbol_end ?> By Phone or Video</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If a PF wants to testify by phone 
 or video, they must obtain a court form to request remote testimony.</p>
