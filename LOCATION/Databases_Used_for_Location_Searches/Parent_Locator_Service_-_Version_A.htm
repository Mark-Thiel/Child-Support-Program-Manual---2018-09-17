<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The FPLS is an assembly of systems 
 operated by OCSE to assist states in locating NCPs, PFs, and CP for the 
 establishment of paternity and child support obligations, as well as the 
 enforcement and modification of orders fro child support, custody, and 
 visitation.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">It also identifies support orders 
 or support cases involving the same parties in different states. The FPLS 
 helps federal and state agencies idenitfy over-payments and fraud,k and 
 assists with assessing benefits. Developed in cooperation with the states, 
 employers, federal agencies, and the judiciary, the FPLS was expanded 
 by Welfare Reform to include:</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="background-color: #ffff00;">??MT- 
 Preceding sentence says it was EXPANDED TO INCLUDE. So it looks like the 
 ones below were ADDED -- meaning it doesn't include the pre-existing one, 
 and is &#160;not a comprehensive list of databases accessed by PLS.</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 80px;">National Directory of New Hires (NDNH)</h3>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 147px;">A

 orders that were entered or changed on or after October 1, 1998. The FCR 
 receives this case information on a daily basis from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">State 
 Case Registry</span> located in each state, and proactively matches it 
 with previous submissions to the FCR and with employment information contained 
 in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">National Directory of New Hires 
 (<?rh-glo_start class="glossterm" ?>NDNH<?rh-glo_end ?>)</span>. Any successful matches are returned to the appropriate

 Parent Locator Service maintained by OCSE.</p>
