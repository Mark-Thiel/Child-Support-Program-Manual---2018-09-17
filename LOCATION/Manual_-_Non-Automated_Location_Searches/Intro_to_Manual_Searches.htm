<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">Introduction 
 to Manual Location Searches</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li><h2>How and when do manual (non-automated) location searches begin?</h2></li>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Some location activity starts 
 at intake, when the worker gathers as much information as possible from 
 the customer and/or the <span class="Notices_name"><a title="LDSS-4882 - Information about Child Support Services and Application/Referral for Child Support Services"

 with a view toward locating the PF/NCP, establishing paternity, and pursuing 
 a support order. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Often, the customer has direct 
 knowledge of or can provide valuable leads as to the PF/NCP's location 
 and/or employer.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">For example, the customer may 
 know the PF/NCP's current or former employer, or may know the PF/NCP's 
 address or former address. &#160;In these instances, the worker should:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Build the appropriate 
		 address record</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Generate a <a title="Wage and Health Benefits Report" 
		 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Support_Establishment/WHBR.pdf" 
		 target="_blank">WHBR</a> for the PF/NCP's <span style="font-style: italic;">last 
		 known</span> employer</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 147px; font-weight: bold; 
	 font-style: italic;">AND/OR</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Generate a <a title="Postal Clearance Letter - Address Information Request"

		 target="_blank">PCL</a>&#160;for the PF/NCP's <span style="font-style: italic;">last 
		 known</span> address.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Even a <span style="font-style: italic;">former</span> 
 employer may be able to provide valuable information, such as:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">PF/NCP's current employer</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">PF/NCP's SSN &#160;<?rh-cbt_start condition="Exclude_from_PDF_output" ?>(See

	<ul style="list-style: disc;">

	</ul>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Likewise, even the Postmaster 
 at a PF/NCP's <span style="font-style: italic;">former</span> address 
 may be able to provide a forwarding address or other leads.</p>
