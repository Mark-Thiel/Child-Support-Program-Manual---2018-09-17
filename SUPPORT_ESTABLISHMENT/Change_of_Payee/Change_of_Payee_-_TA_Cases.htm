<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The <span style="color: #513077; 
													 font-weight: bold;">Child 
 Support Program</span> allows CPs with direct pay orders to have the orders 
 made payable through the CSEU <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">administratively</span> 
 <?rh-symbol_start name="Em Dash" ?>—<?rh-symbol_end ?> without having 
 to petition the family court. This is known as a &quot;Change of Payee&quot; 
 (procedure).</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Once the order is payable through 
 the CSEU, the order is subject to all enforcement and collection tools 
 available to the CSEU.</p>
<h2>Why Is the Payee Being Changed?</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">A Change of Payee (TA cases) scenario 
 is one in which:</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The customer and the 
		 NCP already had a direct pay order between them.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The customer then 
		 applied for temporary assistance.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">TA applicants/recipients 
		 are required to cooperate with the <span style="color: #513077; 
													 font-weight: bold;">Child 
		 Support Program</span> as a condition of receiving temporary assistance. 
		 Therefore, the direct-pay order must be made payable to DSS through 
		 the CSEU.</p></li>
