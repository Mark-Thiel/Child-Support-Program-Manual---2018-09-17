<h1 style="text-align: center;">Continuation of Services when TA benefits 
 cease</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Each week, the WMS system notifies the ASSETS system of temporary assistance 
 cases that have been closed by the TA 
 Unit.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">This happens via transmission 
 of a &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold;">IVA-IVD File</span>&quot; 
 file from WMS to ASSETS.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Specifically, each week:</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">ASSETS receives the 
		 IVA-IVD file from WMS.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The IVA-IVD file notifies 
		 ASSETS of temporary assistance case that have been closed by the 
		 TA Unit during the past week.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">ASSETS generates data 
		 files to be used in constructing <span class="Notices_name">Continuation 
		 of Services</span> letters. </p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">ASSETS sends the data 
		 files to the Processing Center.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The Processing Center 
		 prints and mails the <span class="Notices_name">Continuation of 
		 Services</span> letter to CPs and NCPs.</p></li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Note: 
 The Continuation of Service letters bear the date that the letters were 
 generated by ASSETS â€” 
 not the day they are printed at or mailed from the Processing Center.</p>
