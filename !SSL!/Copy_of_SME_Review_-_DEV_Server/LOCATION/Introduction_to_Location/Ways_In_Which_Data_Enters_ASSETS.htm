		 the Processing Center when paper mail arrives there. &#160;All 
		 paper mail is scanned and imaged upon arrival. Most data is captured 
		 via that scan and fed directly into the computer system at the 
		 Processing Center, but all scans also are reviewed and quality-controlled 
		 by workers there. &#160;The workers manually input any data not 
		 successfully captured through automated means. &#160;The computer
