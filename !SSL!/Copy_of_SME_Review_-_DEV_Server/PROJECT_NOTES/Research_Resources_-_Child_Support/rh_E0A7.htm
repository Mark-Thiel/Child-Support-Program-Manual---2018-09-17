State  Licensing Agencies   Response B-1-a-19:   Information from   the  NYS   Department of State  ( DOS) ,  NYS   DEC,  and  DMV   is received  through an automated interface.  The resulting information is reported on the Professional License screen ( Screen Shot B-1-a-19 ).   State  agencies with jurisdiction over real and perso nal property   Response B-1-a-20:   ASSETS submits and accepts information with  DTF  through an automated interface   and  the information  is  used as an enforcement tool on eligible accounts .  Respondent address and  r e spondent employer information  are  also obtained from this source  ( Screen Shot B-1-a-20 ) .   Tribal IV - D programs   Response B-1-a-21:   Sending and receiving of information through an automated interface with this source is unavailable. Note: Data required to be furnished  to the NDNH by the  State   under the three components of NDNH  ( i.e., new hire information, Quarterly Wage and Unemployment Insurance claimant information )  need not be submitted by the  State wide automated system.  The decision as to which   State  entity will report  this information to the NDNH  is determined by the  State .  However, if data is not reported as required, the Title IV-D  a gency will be held accountable. If an automated interface cannot be established for a specific source: The system must automatically prepare the documen ts required to submit the  case to the information source .   Response B-1-b-1:   I nterfaces are automated.  If needed, a  system- generated request can be made on the ASSETS Status Information screen, Respondent Address screen and  the  Respondent Employer screen to submit a case to information sources    not available through the regularly scheduled automated interface. Opening a  “ V ”   (Postal verification)   or  “ F ”   (Employment and Wage clearances)   group on the Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-1-b-1-i)  will automatically generate the Postal  Clearance (PCL)  or  Wage Health Benefit Report (WHBR) . Also,   by selecting  the  “Yes” radio button on the Respondent Address Details screen for “Do you want Postal Clearance Submitted” ( Screen Shot B-1-b-1-ii ) or selecting  the  “Yes” radio button for “Wage Health and Benefit Report to be sent to the employer” on Respondent Employer Detail Edit Page ( Screen Shot B-1-b-1-iii )  will automatically generate a PCL  or  WHBR document  ( respectively ) .   a nd The system must provide an easily accessible means to enter into the automated case record all manual attempts to obtain information and the results.   Response  B-1-b-2 :   A manual request can be made on  the  ASSETS Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-1-b-2-i ) to o btain information from a source  by o pening a  “ F ”  or  “ V ”   group . Results of the returned documents are reported on the Daily Status Change s  report   in  Worker Alerts  &lt; ( Screen Shot B-1-b-2-ii ). The system must automatically follow up when information is solicited and no response is received within a reasonable amount of time, based on  State  experience. The system must: Re-access the source using an automated interface, if available ,   R esponse B-1-c-1 :   F ollow-up with  all  source s on cases with pending  location   identified by the  L100 status  on the Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-1-C-1 )  is automated .  &lt; All s ources are  re - a cc essed  as necessary through  automated  interfaces  every 75  days . or If an automated interface is not availa ble, notify the caseworker and  a utomatically generate the documents necessary to encourage a response .   Response  B-1-c-2 : All interfaces are automated.   Information received from automated locate source is reported on the  Parent Locator Service   report   in  Worker Alerts   ( Screen Shot B-1-c-2-i ) to the specific worker whose worker code appears  on the Respondent Information  s creen ( Screen Shot B-1-c-2-ii ) .   The  user  will then generate the necessary verification documents, i.e.,  a  PCL by opening a  “ V ”  group or a  WHBR by opening a  “ F ”  group on the Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-1-c-2-iii ) . The system must accept unsolicited locate information from the FPLS as proactive matches occur between  State  participants registered through the FCR and as  State  FCR participants are matched to New Hire, Quarterly Wage and Unemployment Insurance claim records on the National Directory of New Hire. Response  B-1-d :   U nsolicited information   is accepted  from the FPLS. Information received from FPLS is recorded on the Respondent Location screen ( Screen Shot B-1-d-i ) and any exceptions are recorded on  the Respondent Employer screen .   New Hire, Quarterly Wage and Unemployment information  are   recorded on the Respondent Employer screen   ( Screen Shot B-1-d-ii ) .   At a minimum,  the system must make data received electronically through any of the interfaces listed under paragraph (a) above available  online  to the caseworker along with the capability to electronically record in the case record any data received through an interface. Response B-1-e:   All data received electronically through any of the interfaces listed in paragraph (a) are stored in the case record.  Optional :  Even if the State has an automated interface, there is benefit to being able to also submit a manual locate request to several sources.  Response B-1-f:   Users in local districts have the capability to manually submit a locate request by  opening an L00 1   status   on the Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-1-f ) .

This link is  to West Virginia’s presentation:  http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pubs/2006/conference/locate/ http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pubs/2006/conference/locate/ B-2   &lt; OBJECTIVE:   The system must record, maintain, and track locate activities to ensure compliance with program standards. Federal Statutory and Regulatory Authority : 42 USC 654 (8) 45 CFR 303.3(b)(1) and (3) 45 CFR 307.10(b) (2), (4)(ii), &amp;  (1 4 ) State   System Requirements: The system must,  when  locate action is required , be able to : Automatically submit the case  t o all appropriate locate sources (whether automated or not), including the  transfer of appropriate cases to the  FPLS , within 75 calendar days of determining that locate action is required , Response  B-2-a-1 :   Location information requests are directed to appropriate sources on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The ASSETS “quick turnaround” process sends all cases i dentified by the local district s  to  DTF  and  NYS DOL  on a nightly basis.  A ll  manually or  automatically   flagged cases for locate  are  submi t t ed  to FPLS and SPLS on a weekly basis.  A   user  location  request  is  generated  in the system by the opening of an “L001” (location)  status  on the Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-2-a-1-i ).  If the case requires  a  location at the time  of  the Case Intake process,  the  “ Address Unknown” ch eck box is selected for the “NCP’s Current or Last Known Mailing Address” ( Screen Shot B-2-a-1-ii ) and   the  system will automatic ally open an “L001” status  on the Status Information screen. Cases are also submitted for location when appropriate indicators are present in automated enforcement programs such as the Income Withholding Order (IWO) process. All cases without an order and those where no payment and/or employer  are   known to ASSETS are submitted to the FPLS and SPLS  for location activity.  Automated electronic exchange of information of the entire database (Mass Match) also occurs on a monthly basis.  Cases that need location effort are opened within required time frame and  automatically  resubmitted every 75 days.    Track responses from each automated locate source,   including verified address information ,   Response  B-2-a-2 :   Source codes and verification dates as well as address and employer information from each source  are  recorded on the appropriate Respondent  Address  screen  ( Screen Shot B-2-a-2-i )   and  Respondent Employer Summary screen ( Screen Shot B-2-a-2-ii ) All updated address “H its ”   are recorded  o n  the Respondent Location screen  ( Screen Shot B-2-a-2-iii )  and  the messages are  reported on the Parent Locator Service  report   in   Worker Alerts ( Screen Shot B-2-a-2-iv ).  T he verification process ( e . g ., PCL, and WHBR) can be manually or automatically initiated on the Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-2-a-2-v ).   Support the tracking of information from manual locate sources , Response  B-2-a-3 :   Information from manual locate sources  are   tracked on the  Respondent Information ( Screen Shot B-2-a-3-i ), Respondent Address ( Screen Shot B-2-a-3-ii ), Respondent Financial ( Screen Shot B-2-a-3-iii ) and the Respondent Employer  s creens ( Screen Shot B-2-a-3-iv ) .     Record and maintain information on positive responses received from locate sources.   A minimum of three verified addresses, in addition to the home and mailing addresses, must be maintained online, if they are available , Response  B-2-a-4 :   T he history  of respondent residential and mailing addresses  on the Respondent Address  s creen   ( Screen Shot B-2-a-4-i )  can be identified by the verification indicator. A ll current and previous employers are maintained on the Respondent Employer  screen  ( Screen Shot B-2-a-4-ii ) a nd Respondent Employer Summary  s creen  ( Screen Shot B-2-a-4-iii ).  Record, on a monthly basis, information on all locate sources accessed during the previous month , Response B-2-a -5 :     L ocate requests require a “one for one” response. A “H it ” or “N o  H it ” message will appear in the Dispositio n (DISP) field on the  Respondent  Location  s creen for each source. All lead information is recorded either manually or  automatically   in the online history on the appr opriate Respondent Information  s creens; address informa tion on the Respondent Address  s creen ( Screen Shot B-2-a-5-i ) and employment information on the Respondent Employer   s creen  ( Screen Shot B-2-a-5-ii ).  When necessary, alert the caseworker to verify responses received to ensure that sufficient information is available to allow the next appropriate action to be taken ,  and Response B-2-a-6 : Information received from automated locate and employment interfaces is repo rted on the  Parent Locator Service   report  ( Screen Shot B-2-a-6-i ) to the specific worker whose code appears on the Respondent Information screen ( Screen Shot B-2-a-6-ii ). The worker will then generate the nec essary verification documents,  e . g .,  PCL, WHBR  report documents .  &lt; Forward cases to the next appropriate function when sufficient information is available. Response  B-2-a -7 :   When information has been verified and the location status  is   closed   on Status Information screen , the worker is notified of the status change by the Daily Status Change s  report   in  Worker Alerts  and any process requiring a verified address is resumed.  For example, when a new hire lead is received, ASSETS generates a &lt; WHBR  and income withholding order   ( Screen Shot B-2-a-7 ) . If caseworker action is required, the system must alert the caseworker of the needed action in sufficient time to allow the 75-day timeframe to be met.  Response B-2-b:   The aging parameter   on  each status entered on the Status Information   s creen ( Screen Shot B-2-b-i ) automatically alerts the caseworker of needed action within a given timeframe. Aged statuses are reported on the  Overage Statuses  report   in  Worker Alerts  ( Screen Shot B-2-b-ii ). Tickler dates may be entered on the Case Information  s creen ( Screen Shot B-2-b-iii ).    The  Overage Summary report is used by supervisors to review the overage d  statuses by worker code. The system  must   automatically follow up when information is solicited and no response is received after a reasonable amount of time.   The system  must : Reaccess the source using an automated interface, if available , Response B-2-c-1 : F ollow-up with  all  source s on cases with pending location  on  the Status Information screen ( Screen Shot B-1-c-1 )  is automated .  All s&lt; ources are re - a cc essed as necessary through ASSETS interfaces  every 75 days. or If an automated interface is not available, notify the caseworker and automatically generate the documents necessary to encourage a response. R esponse  B-2-c-2 :   All interfaces  are  automated.   Information received from  an  automated locate source is reported  on  the  Parent Locator Service   report  in Worker Alerts   ( Screen Shot B-2-c-2-i ) to the specific  worker  whose  worker  code appears on the Respondent Information  s creen ( Screen Shot B-2-c-2-ii ).   The  user   will then generate the necessary verification documents, i.e.,   a   PCL by opening a  “ V ”  group  or a   WHBR by opening a n   “ F ”  group on the Status Information screen  ( Screen Shot B-2-c-2-iii ) . d. Does the system maintain and report data on: (1) the number of cases submitted to each locate source; and (2) the transmittal timeframes associated with each submission? Response B-2-d:   ASSETS reports the number of locate stats for given month. The number of cases submitted to each locate source can be compiled on demand based upon information in the  monthly  database unload file . The transmittal and response dates are recorded in the send and received date fields found on  Respondent  Location  screen  ( Screen Shot B-2-d ). Recommended Data Elements:   The CSE Data Standards Registry is operational and includes over 1,000 principle data elements.  The data standards registry contains data elements that are exchanged between CSE partners, their definition, name and other defining attributes.

A user can search for data elements by definition (with references), name, and format, and relevant business rules. The search facility will also return data elements that are identical or similar and will list the data exchanges where they are used. Locate Tip : FPLS offers an option to filter locate addresses to avoid duplication. Several States have instituted similar filters on their statewide CSE system to limit caseworker alerts of duplicate address data or address data over a certain date. Locate Tip : Several States have found the information derived from matches with Cell phone companies to be useful. This is the link to their suggested data elements:   http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pubs/2007/conference/presentations/conference_presentation_cell_phones.htm http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cse/pubs/2007/conference/presentations/conference_presentation_cell_phones.htm B-3     OBJECTIVE:  The system must automatically resubmit cases to locate sources. Federal Statutory and Regulatory Authority : 42 USC 654 (8) 45 CFR 303.3(b)(5) 45 CFR 307.10(b)(1 4 ) State   System Requirements: Whenever key locate data elements are added or changed due to the receipt of new information, the system must immediately resubmit the case to all appropriate automated and manual locate sources, with the exception of FPLS.   Response  B-3-a:   Whenever key locate data elements are added or changed, (e.g., when  NCP ’s   Name,   SSN  or  D ate of Birth   is  changed ) the system automatically initiates a SPLS search  to  DTF  and NYS   DOL  ( Screen Shot B-3-a ) .  An  FCR  person   transaction  is  generated to notify  the  FCR of the change . At least quarterly, the system must automatically resubmit all cases in locate   to the  State  Employment Security Agency and to all other automated locate sources, with the exception of FPLS. Response B-3-b :   Cases  in open location status  are submitted to  State Employment Security Agency  as well as all other automated locate sources, on a monthly basis. The system  must   follow-up with a locate source, when based on  State  experience, a response is significantly late. Response B-3-c :   All cases where location is not complete are   resubmitted to the FPLS/SPLS sources  every 75 days  until an address is verified. In addition ,  every month  the  entire the active case load is sent to the Wage Reporting System at  DTF  as well as the  NYS   DOL  for updated location information.   Recommended Data Elements:  The CSE Data Standards Registry is operational and includes over 1,000 principle data elements.  The data standards registry contains data elements that are exchanged between CSE partners, their definition, name and other defining attributes.

Receive automated information back from  the  FPLS : R ecord the results of the match in the automated case record and   notify the caseworker of the results ,   Response  B-4 -3 - a :   L ocate requests require a “one for one” response. A  disposition reason code  will  appear in the Disposition   field on the Respondent  Location  s creen ( Screen shot B-4-3-a ) for each source  and the address leads will be updated  on  the case.  The u ser  is notified  by the  P arent  L ocator  S ervice  report   in  Worker Alerts  of all the responses received .  or Provide the data electronically online to the caseworker along with the capability to electronically record in the case record any data received from the FPLS. Response B-4 - 3-b:   The case worker is notified of the FPLS results on the  Parent Locator Service  report  on Worker Alerts . Note: The system must have the capability to submit any  locate request   to FPLS in accordance with  State  procedures. Submissions to FPLS for locate must include:   Name of person to be located , Person’s SSN, if known ,  and Note: I f the S SN  is unknown, the system  should  attempt to ascertain the number, using automated interfaces . If the SSN is unknown, the FPLS will attempt to identify an SSN for the  State  if, at a minimum, a date of birth is submitted with the person’s information. Any other information  will be  prescribed by ACF in instructions which are issued periodically in the form of an Action Transmittal. Response B-4-b:   FPLS submissions include the required cr iteria i.e.,  NCP ’s name, SSN and information prescribed by ACF, in accordance with the specifications set forth in the FPLS State User’s G uide.

Response B-4-d :   Foster Care only requests are processed  to all locate sources.  Only results appropriate for foster care are provided to the foster care staff.  Recommended Data Elements:  The CSE Data Standards Registry is operational and includes over 1,000 principle data elements.  The data standards registry contains data elements that are exchanged between CSE partners, their definition, name and other defining attributes. This link  http://www.acf.hhs.gov/cse/dsr/ http://www.acf.hhs.gov/cse/dsr/   takes you to the Registry .  Clicking on Community/Guest Users on the Welcome page and then   clicking on Info will give you access to the User’s Guide on how to access and use the CSE Data Standards Registry. A user can search for data elements by definition (with references), name, and format, and relevant business rules. The search facility will also return data elements that are identical or similar and will list the data exchanges where they are used.
