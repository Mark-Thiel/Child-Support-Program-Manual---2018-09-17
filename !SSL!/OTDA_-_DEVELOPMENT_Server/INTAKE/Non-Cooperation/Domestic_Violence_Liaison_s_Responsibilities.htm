<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="background-color: #ffff00;">Content below was taken from 03-ADM-05.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">DVLs must conduct an assessment interview with the TA or MA applicant/recipient to determine the credibility of the assertion of domestic violence.

<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Depending on the circumstances, a waiver may or may not be the best option for the applicant/recipient.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The DVL must provide and discuss with the victim/applicant the "<span class="Notices_name">Notice Regarding Child Support Requirements for Victims of Domestic Violence</span>." This notice must be reproduced locally. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This notice must NOT be mailed to the client.</span></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">When necessary, and with the permission of the client, the DVL may need to consult with the CSE <a href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="HotSpot12117" class="glossterm">worker</a><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[

//]]></script><span class="glosstext" id="POPUP12117" style="display: none;"> In the Child Support Services Operations Manual, the term &quot;worker&quot; (in upper- or lower-case) refers to personnel working in any child support function.</span> in complex situations. The DVL needs to be familiar with the CSE services and requirements, so he/she <a href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="HotSpot31265" class="glossterm">can</a><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[

An individual person may have multiple CAN numbers. This is different from a CIN number, which identifies an individual person and can span serveral services under the umbrella of social services. (See glossary entry for CIN number.)</span> properly advise the TA applicant/recipient of their options, including pursuing child support safely. After the assessment process, the DVL must notify CSE of the waiver decision. If a CSE waiver has been granted and subsequently ends, the DVL must notify CSE that the waiver has ended. LDSS staff must follow locally developed procedures for this notification process while ensuring confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The DVL will make all waiver decisions.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">A waiver is a temporary suspension of one or more TA program requirements (e.g., child support cooperation requirement). Waivers may be granted by a DVL where compliance with program requirements would make it more difficult for the individual and/or the individual’s children to escape from DV or subject them to further risk of DV. Waivers must be for an initial period of at least four months and may be extended, modified or terminated as appropriate. If a waiver is extended, the waiver must be reviewed at least every six months.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">It is important to remember that in some situations the abuser could be a legally responsible relative, not the biological parent, who is required under TA regulations to provide child support payments, e.g. a child’s stepparent. In cases with multiple non-custodial parents, the DVL must identify the abuser and may only apply the waiver to the specific support case. In this situation, it is considered a full waiver and not a partial waiver as indicated in previous data entry procedures.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">During the assessment interview the DVL needs to explain what cooperating with CSE entails, as well as the potential impact of a waiver. CSE cooperation includes providing identifying information about the absent parent/putative father and their address and participating in necessary activities with the child support office and the court to establish paternity and establish, modify or enforce support obligations. Refer to <a title="99-ADM-05" href="http://otda.ny.gov/policy/directives/1999/ADM/99_ADM-05.pdf" target="_blank">99 ADM-5</a> or 369.2(b) of the regulations for further information). The DVL needs to explain that safety risks may occur from cooperating with CSE requirements, as well as after an order is filed, enforced or stopped.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&#160;</p>
<h2>Waiver Options</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">There are three child support waiver options:</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 67px;">No Waiver:</h3>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Proceed with CSE activites as usual.</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 67px;">Full Waiver:</h3>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">STOP all CSE activities.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Full CSE waivers are granted if any CSE activity will put the victiim and/or the victim's children at risk.</p>
<h3 style="margin-left: 67px;">Partial Waiver:</h3>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">The regulations outlined in 98 ADM-3 and subsequent directives do not provide direction for granting partial waivers. Computer coding was developed to allow for partial waivers when victims could participate in some but not all program requirements. The definition of partial waivers under CSE program requirements is being redefined and is more restrictive than has been allowed in the past. Under no circumstances can the DVL grant waivers for only some child support enforcement activities and not others. (e.g. waivers granted for tax offset but not a drivers license suspension). If a partial waiver is granted, CSE may:</p>

<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Not call the victim to testify at the hearing or, if his or her testimony is required, request that the court make adequate provision for his or her safety while in court.

<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">It is important to understand that even though a partial waiver is granted, CSE will still proceed with CSE activities but with the precautions stated above.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">All waivers, including partial waivers, are granted to ensure the victim’s safety and confidentiality. When a DVL grants a waiver and enters this data into the DV <a href="javascript:TextPopup(this)" id="HotSpot49809" class="glossterm">WMS</a><script type="text/javascript">//<![CDATA[
TextPopupInit('HotSpot49809', 'POPUP49809');
//]]></script><span class="glosstext" id="POPUP49809" style="display: none;"> Welfare Management System. ?MT - Medicaid and TA cases are in the WMS System? Need explanation.</span> subsystem, this will initiate a DV indicator on “WMS Screen 3” (WINQ03) during a case comprehensive inquiry. The purpose of this indicator is to alert workers to the possible safety implications and to proceed with caution. Without this DV indicator, the client’s safety may be jeopardized.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">When a waiver is granted, the DVL must develop a “services plan” with the client. This plan is designed to lead the victim to safety and self-sufficiency. The plan will list recommendations, referrals and/or options that are available to assist the victim. Most of the services will be available through DV service providers. The DVL’s role is to assist the individual in identifying and accessing resources, not to counsel or provide the recommended services. The services plan is not a list of requirements. The individual has the option of whether or not to act on these referrals. The services plan is a way to document and formalize the referrals given.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">Once the DVL completes the assessment and makes a waiver decision, she/he must notify the appropriate workers, based on local procedures, of the waiver decision.</p>
