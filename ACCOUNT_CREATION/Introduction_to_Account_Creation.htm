<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Once the court issues an <a title="Order of Support" 
	 href="https://www.nycourts.gov/forms/familycourt/pdfs/4-7.pdf" target="_blank">Order 
 of Support</a>, the information contained in it must be entered into the 
 case record, and an account and ledgers must be created. Ledgers are sometimes 
 referred to as &quot;sub-accounts.&quot;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The ledgers pertain to xxx &#160;Example: 
 &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">See 
 also:</span> &#160;COLA &gt; Eligibility &gt; <a title="Ledger Codes: Meaning &amp; Syntax"

													 id="a4">Ledger Codes: 
 Meaning &amp; Syntax</a></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Each account can contain a maximum 
 of 18 ledgers (aka sub-accounts). &#160;If the maximum number of ledgers 
 has been reached, but the case/account requires more ledgers, the worker 
 must:</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="background-color: #ffff00;">Create 
 a new case</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="background-color: #ffff00;">Create 
 a new account</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="background-color: #ffff00;">Link 
 cases -- What if there is ALREADY a case re the CP, NCP, or child found 
 upon Basic Search or Advanced Search? &#160;What do you do?</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Why would a case require so many 
 ledgers? &#160;What are all these ledgers for? &#160;What do they pertain 
 to?</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="background-color: #ffff00;">Of 
 course, it would be rare for a new account, upon creation...for a new 
 support order to require 18 ledgers or more...</p>
