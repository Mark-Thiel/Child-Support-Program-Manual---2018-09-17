<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">NOTES 
 re Account Creation</h1>
<ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
	<li style="list-style: decimal;"><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In 
	 order to issue an <a title="IWO - Income Withholding Order" href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Income_Withholding/IWO.pdf" 
							 target="_blank">IWO</a>, the <span class="Field_Name">Wage 
	 Order Delinquency</span> field in ASSETS must contain a value of at 
	 least $1.00 (one dollar). &#160;</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><img src="../Graphics_Global/Learn more button - green 25 percent.png" 
												 alt="" style="border: none;" 
												 border="0" /></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">The 
 requirement to have a value of at least $1.00 (one dollar) in the <span 
	 class="Field_Name">Wage Order Delinquency</span> field in the case 
 record is purely a technological requirement of ASSETS. &#160;</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">The 
 reason for this requirement?</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">In 
 the past, <a title="IWO - Income Withholding Order" href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Income_Withholding/IWO.pdf" 
				 target="_blank">IWO</a>s were issued only in cases where 
 NCPs with support orders were neglecting to make their legally-required 
 child support payments (i.e. these were delinquent accounts). &#160;In 
 such cases, an <a title="IWO - Income Withholding Order" href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Income_Withholding/IWO.pdf" 
					 target="_blank">Income Withholding Order</a> (<a title="IWO - Income Withholding Order" 
	 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Income_Withholding/IWO.pdf" 
	 target="_blank">IWO</a>) was issued for the purpose of deducting child 
 support payments directly from an NCP's paycheck <?rh-symbol_start name="Em Dash" ?>â€”<?rh-symbol_end ?> 
 as an <span style="font-style: italic;">enforcement</span> measure.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">These 
 days, an Income Withholding Order is&#160;no longer an <span style="font-style: italic;">enforcement</span> 
 measure, per se, used only on delinquent accounts. Instead, an <a title="IWO - Income Withholding Order" 
	 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Income_Withholding/IWO.pdf" 
	 target="_blank">IWO</a> is the <span style="font-style: italic;">standard 
 and preferred</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">collection</span> 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">mechanism</span> for <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> 
 accounts -- not just delinquent accounts. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">Nonetheless, 
 for purely technological cause-and-effect reasons, ASSETS needs a &quot;delinquency&quot; 
 on an account to justify the issuing of an<a title="IWO - Income Withholding Order" 
												 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Income_Withholding/IWO.pdf" 
												 target="_blank">IWO</a>. 
 Therefore, to satisfy this technological requirement, workers typically 
 enter a value of $1.00 (one dollar) into the <span class="Field_Name">Wage 
 Order Delinquency</span> field so that ASSETS will allow an <a title="IWO - Income Withholding Order" 
	 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Income_Withholding/IWO.pdf" 
	 target="_blank">IWO</a> to be generated for the case.</p>
