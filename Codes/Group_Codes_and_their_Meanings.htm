<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">There are many different kinds 
 of codes relevant to the ASSETS computer program. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Status 
 and Reason Codes</span>, though, are particularly important because they 
 give (in great detail/granularity) ongoing status reports/updates for 
 any given case. The Status Codes can give a worker a snapshot of the current 
 status of a case, as well as a step-by-step, chronological, granular history 
 of the case. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Virtually any and all actions 
 taken on a case or affecting a case – whether they are fully automated 
 actions, court actions, or actions performed by workers at the CSEU or 
 the Processing Center <?rh-symbol_start name="Em Dash" ?>—<?rh-symbol_end ?> 
 are reflected in and reported to the worker via <span style="font-weight: bold;">Status 
 and Reason Codes</span>.</p>
