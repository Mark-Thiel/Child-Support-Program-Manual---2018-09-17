<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">Other 
 Points to be Aware Of</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Beyond the information contained 
 in <a href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/HTML/Interstate_Case_Assistant/ICA_01.html">Interstate 
 Case Assistant</a> and in other sections of this chapter, there are factors 
 that affect cases themselves and your processing of them:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nondisclosure 
	 affidavit</span>: In addition to the safeguards that apply to all 
	 cases, this is an extra measure of safety that UIFSA provides for 
	 parties and children in interstate cases. In New York law, it is covered 
	 in <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/FCT/580-312"><span 
	 class="Legislation_Titles">FCA 580-312</span></a>. Information about 
	 when and how to use it is incorporated in <a href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/HTML/Interstate_Case_Assistant/ICA_01.html">Interstate 
	 Case Assistant</a> at the points where it is appropriate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">A tribunal 
 that receives a nondisclosure affidavit must prevent identifying information 
 about the party or child from being disclosed to the other party or the 
 public. The other party has the right to request a hearing in that tribunal 
 to attempt to have the information disclosed; the tribunal must then base 
 its decision on the interests of justice.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Establishing 
	 orders</span>: Calculation of the support obligation and duration 
	 of support are set by the laws of the state issuing the order.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Modifying 
	 orders</span>: Only one state at a time has the authority to modify 
	 the order. (That state can be identified by using <a href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/HTML/Interstate_Case_Assistant/ICA_01.html">Interstate 
	 Case Assistant</a>.) This authority is called continuing, exclusive 
	 jurisdiction (CEJ).</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enforcing 
	 orders</span>: Interest on arrears is calculated according to the 
	 law of the state that issued the order.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Case 
	 closure</span>: Several of the state and federal criteria for case 
	 closure are specific to interstate cases. These criteria are incorporated 
	 in the automated case closure process, so if you keep the case record 
	 up to date as a standard part of case processing, an interstate case 
	 will be system-selected for case closure when appropriate in the same 
	 way as a local case would be.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Problems 
	 with other states</span>: If you encounter a problem with another 
	 state that you can't resolve, you'll need to provide precise an thorough 
	 detail about it. This includes specifying to the extent possible the 
	 state; the entity (child support agency, court, etc.); the office 
	 (name of county, parish, borough, etc.); the individual; the date 
	 and time (or sequence of dates); and what exactly they did that they 
	 shouldn't have, or didn't do that they should have. Using that detail, 
	 discuss the issue with your supervisor or coordinator, who can then 
	 contact your DCSS county representative if necessary.</p></li>
