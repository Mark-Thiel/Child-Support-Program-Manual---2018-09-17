 of Scope</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In the context of the <span style="color: #513077; 
	 font-weight: bold;">Child Support Program</span>, &quot;interstate&quot; 
 mean that the case in some way crosses the state lines. This could mean, 
 for example, that one parent is in New York and one is in another state; 
 both parents are in New York but their child support order was issued 
 by another state; or neither parent is in New York but a New York child 
 support enforcement unit is providing services on the case.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The term &quot;state&quot; refers 
 to any state of the U.S., as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto 
 Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The category &quot;interstate&quot; 
 is distinct from &quot;local&quot; (involving only one state), &quot;inter-county&quot; 
 (involving more than one county within a single state), &quot;international&quot; 
 (involving more than one nation), and &quot;tribal&quot; (involving the 
 jurisdiction of an Indian nation or tribe).</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Many aspects of an interstate 
 case are the same as for local cases (such as building a case and account 
 in ASSETS, monitoring Worker Alerts for actions needed, and implementation 
 of automated enforcement measures after an account is built). This chapter 
 addresses only the specific aspects that are unique to interstate cases, 
 and is oriented to the caseworker perspective.</p>
