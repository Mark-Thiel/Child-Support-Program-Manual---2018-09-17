<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">Interstate 
 laws</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The primary law governing interstate 
 case processing is <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> (<span 
	 class="Legislation_Titles">Uniform Interstate Family Support Act</span>). 
 Every state was required to adopt <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
 into its state law, by 1996 federal regulations, so as to make interstate 
 case processing clearly standardized throughout the U.S. Subsequent regulations 
 have required each state to adopt an updated version of the <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span>, 
 referred to as <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA 2008</span>, into 
 its state law. New York's <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
 statute is <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/FCT/A5-B">Article 
 5-B of the Family Court Act</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
 includes provisions specifying that it is to be read in combination with 
 other state laws. For example, <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
 sets forth the process for establishing an order in an interstate case, 
 but does not dictate the calculation for setting a support obligation; 
 therefore, that calculation would be governed by the law of the state 
 where the order is established.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In addition to <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
 and other state law, there is a 1994 federal law called the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title28/html/USCODE-2011-title28-partV-chap115-sec1738B.htm">Full 
 Faith and Credit for Child Support Orders Act</a>, which simply duplicated 
 some but not all sections of <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span>. 
 The 1996 federal regulation requiring all states to adopt <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
 made the <span class="Legislation_Titles">Full Faith and Credit Act</span> 
 essentially redundant, though it continues to be in effect.</p>
