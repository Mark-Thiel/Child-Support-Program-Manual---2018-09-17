<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">Action 
 Prompts and Corresponding Responsibilities</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">These are the prompts that indicate 
 you need to do something regarding an interstate case, and the steps you 
 need to take when they occur:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If you need to initiate 
	 the establishment, enforcement, or modification of an order, and you 
	 find that the case involves a party in another state or an order issued 
	 by another state, use the <a href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/HTML/Interstate_Case_Assistant/ICA_01.html">Interstate 
	 Case Assistant</a> to identify how to proceed, then take the actions 
	 it directs you to do.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">At least one person in 
	 each district needs to review the CSENETINFOREPORT every day to check 
	 for messages from other states. If you are responsible for doing that:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li style="list-style: none; display: inline;"><ol style="list-style: decimal;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Access the report 
		 daily through <span class="Databases">COLD</span>.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Use the <a href="http://sitweb06.otda.state.nyenet/assets/Xexperimental/Xplaceholder.html">CSENETINFOREPORT 
		 Action Guide</a> to identify the response needed for the messages 
		 that have come in.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Take the actions directed 
		 by the Guide.</p></li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If an action for establishment, 
	 enforcement, or modification of an order is already in progress for 
	 an interstate case, and you need to ask for information from or provide 
	 information to another state, looks on the <a href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/HTML/Interstate_Case_Assistant/ICA_56.html">&quot;Case 
	 needs something besides establishment, enforcement, or modification&quot;</a> 
	 page of the <a href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/HTML/Interstate_Case_Assistant/ICA_01.html">Interstate 
	 Case Assistant</a> to identify how to proceed, then take the actions 
	 it directs you to do.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Other than the initiation 
	 of an action, the working of the CSENETINFOREPORT, and the exchange 
	 of information, the processing of an interstate case at the district 
	 level of the child support program is essentially the same as in a 
	 local case. Therefore, each day, review and respond to Worker Alerts 
	 messages, <span class="Databases">COLD</span> reports, and <span class="Databases">ECS</span> 
	 referrals. By doing that as a standard part of caseload management, 
	 you will address the tasks needed for interstate cases as they arise.</p></li>
</ul>
