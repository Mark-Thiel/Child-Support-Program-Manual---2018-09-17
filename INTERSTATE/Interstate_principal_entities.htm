<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 24pt;">Principal 
 entities</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Interstate cases involve several 
 key entities that do not arise in local case processing:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Initiating 
	 state</span> is used to refer to the state of the child support agency 
	 that asks for action to be taken or information to be provided by 
	 an entity in another state. For example, in the statement &quot;New 
	 York wants the order modified by California,&quot; New York is the 
	 initiating state, and &quot;New York&quot; is understood to mean &quot;the 
	 agency within New York&quot; rather than the state government as a 
	 whole.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Responding 
	 state</span> is used to refer to the state of the entity that is asked 
	 to take action or provide information at the request of a child support 
	 agency in another state. For example, in the statement &quot;New York 
	 wants the order modified by California,&quot; California is the responding 
	 state, and &quot;California&quot; is understood to mean &quot;the 
	 child support agency and/or tribunal within California&quot; rather 
	 than the state government as a whole.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Central 
	 registry</span> is a state-level unit within each state's child support 
	 agency. Its function is to be the central point of the initial contact 
	 from another state in any case being processed through the child support 
	 program. For example, if New York wants California to modify an order, 
	 to initiate the request New York would send documents needed to California's 
	 Central Registry, which would review and then forward the documents 
	 to the appropriate local destination within California. Thereafter 
	 for that case, New York would communicate directly with the local 
	 office within California.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">New 
 York's Central Registry is part of the processing center and is responsible 
 for processing incoming interstate requests.</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tribunal</span> 
	 is the entity that a state has designated, in its <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
	 statute, as having the authority to conduct formal proceedings in 
	 interstate cases (such as establishing or modifying an order, or holding 
	 a hearing for enforcement). <span class="Legislation_Titles">UIFSA</span> 
	 specifies the rights, responsibilities, and limitations of the tribunal. 
	 In some states the tribunal is a court, in some it is the child support 
	 agency itself, and in some the responsibilities are distributed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">New 
 York's tribunal is family court.</p>
