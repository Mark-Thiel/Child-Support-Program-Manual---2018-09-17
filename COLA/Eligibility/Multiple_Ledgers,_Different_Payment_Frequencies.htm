<h1 style="text-align: center;">Multiple Ledgers, Different Payment Frequencies</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Normalizing Ledgers with Different 
 Payment Frequencies:</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Various eligible ledgers under 
 any given account may have both different payment amounts and different 
 payment frequencies. Some ledgers are weekly, some are every two weeks, 
 some are twice a month, some are monthly, and so on.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">For the purposes of calculating 
 a COLA, the payment frequencies&#160;of 
 all eligible ledgers are normalized 
 to the frequency of the ledger 
 with the shortest cycle.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">For example, if an account has 
 some ledgers that are annual, some that are monthly, and some that are 
 weekly, all ledgers will be normalized&#160;to weekly rates for all eligible 
 ledgers involved. The rates are then figured into a total [weekly] sum 
 eligible for a COLA increase.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The total weekly sum is multiplied 
 by the COLA percentage to arrive at a dollar amount for the COLA increase 
 per week.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Then, all ledgers are recalculated 
 back to their actual frequencies, and the COLA increase percentage is 
 applied to each eligible ledger proportionately. </p>
