 CP or NCP Address (Seemingly) On Its Own</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Data entered into ASSETS by CSEU 
 workers will not modify any data in the WMS system <?rh-symbol_start name="Em Dash" ?>â€”<?rh-symbol_end ?> 
 but some changes made in the WMS system can modify or update data in the 
 ASSETS system automatically.</p>

<h2>How and when does WMS change a CP or NCP address in ASSETS?</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">When ASSETS receives from WMS 
 a file containing a address for a CP or NCP, ASSETS reads the file and 
 compares the address to the address that ASSETS already has.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If the address in ASSETS is more 
 than 60 days old and the address from WMS is different from the one that 
 ASSETS already has, ASSETS updates the address to match the address as 
 reflected in the WMS system.</p>
