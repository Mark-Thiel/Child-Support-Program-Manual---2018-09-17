<h1 style="text-align: center;">Workarounds We've Encountered in Intake 
 Procedures</h1>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In some districts, the 
	 TA Unit will first 
	 build a case with sanctions (as a default), and then lift the sanctions 
	 once they receive an LDSS-2959 from the CSEU 
	 notifying them of cooperation. 
	 (This is done in order to expedite case-building.)</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In some districts, the 
	 CSEU will build a TA case first as a Non-TA case, and then convert 
	 it to a TA case once the TA Unit's temporary assistance case goes 
	 active. &#160;(This is in order to expedite case-building.)</p></li>
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In some districts, even 
	 if the CSEU does not have the minimum information required to build 
	 a case, they will build a &quot;shell case,&quot; using whatever info 
	 they have, and filling in placeholders for the rest. &#160;(This is 
	 in order to expedite case-building.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 67px;">For 
 example, for a DOB, they 
 will enter something like 06/18/00, or 000-00-0000 for a social security 
 number. (This is in order to expedite case-building.)</p>
