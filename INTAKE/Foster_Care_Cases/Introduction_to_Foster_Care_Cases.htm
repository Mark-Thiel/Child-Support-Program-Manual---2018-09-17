<h1 style="text-align: center;">Foster Care Cases</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="text-align: center;">What 
 is the difference between Title IV-E Foster Care and Non-Title IV-E Foster 
 Care?</p>
<h2>IV-E Foster Care</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;">Title 
 IV-E Foster Care expenditures are reimbursable by up to 66% by the federal 
 government. &#160;</p>
<?rh-cbt_start condition="SOURCE_of_Information" ?><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" 
														 style="color: #ff0000;">Source: 
 Sarah</p><?rh-cbt_end ?>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;">To 
 build a IV-E Foster Care case, select the <span class="Datafield_Name">IV-E 
 Foster Care</span> radio button at the top of the <a title="Online application form" 
														 href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../../Screens_You_Will_Encounter_-_Master_List/Application_Form_-_Intake_Module.htm',950,1000);" 
														 id="a11">online 
 application form</a>, then build the case as you would a Non-TA case.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;">To 
 build a IV-E Foster Care case, the worker must select the<span class="Datafield_Name"> 
 IV-E Foster Care</span> radio button.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0px;"><img 
	 src="../../image7.gif" alt="" style="border: Solid 1px #000000;" border="1" /></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: bold;">In 
 order to select that radio button, the following conditions must be met:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;">The 
	 <span class="Field_Name">Child Services Code</span> must be set to 
	 <span class="Code_Value"><a title="Child Services Category Codes" 
								 href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../../Codes/Child_Services_Category_Codes.htm',800,400);" 
								 id="a2">Code E</a></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 107px;">AND</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;"><span 
	 class="Field_Name">Case Type</span> must be &quot;<span class="Code_Value"><a 
	 title="Case Type Codes" href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../../Codes/Case_Type_Codes.htm',800,800);" 
	 id="a4">40</a></span>&quot; for upstate, or &quot;<span class="Code_Value"><a 
	 title="Case Type Codes" href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../../Codes/Case_Type_Codes.htm',800,1000);" 
	 id="a5">13</a></span>&quot; for NYC.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;">ASSETS 
 will open a <span class="Code_Value"><a title="Group Codes and Their Meanings" 
										 href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../../Codes/C_Group_-_Status_and_Reason_Codes.htm',800,1000);" 
										 id="a3">C Group</a></span> status, 
 specific to Title IV-E Foster Care cases, to ensure proper federal reporting.</p>
<h2>Non-IV-E Foster Care</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;">Non-Title 
 IV-E Foster Care cases receive no funding from the federal government. 
 They are funded entirely through non-federal sources, such as state or 
 county funding. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="font-weight: normal;">To 
 build a Non-IV-E Foster Care case, select the <span class="Field_Name">Non-IV-E 
 Foster Care</span> radio button at the top of the <a title="Online application form" 
														 href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../../Screens_You_Will_Encounter_-_Master_List/Application_Form_-_Intake_Module.htm',950,1000);" 
														 id="a1">online 
 application form</a>, then build the case as you would a Non-TA case.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="text-align: center; margin-left: 0px;"><img 
	 src="image8.gif" alt="" style="border: Solid 1px #000000;" border="1" /></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">When the worker builds a Non-IV-E 
 Foster Care case, ASSETS opens a <span class="Code_Value"><a title="Y Group - Status and Reason Codes" 
	 href="javascript:BSSCPopup('../../Codes/Y_Group_-_Status_and_Reason_Codes.htm',800,1000);" 
	 id="a6">Y Group</a></span> status, ensuring that these cases are not 
 reported as eligible for federal reimbursement.</p>
