<?rh-cbt_start condition="DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_ONLY" ?><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" 
														 style="background-color: #ffffff;">Sarah 
 says that the <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Date of 
 Referral</span> is the date that the CAN # was added to the database. 
 <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">(Which database? WMS, or ASSETS/<?rh-cbt_start condition="DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_ONLY" ?>CSMS<?rh-cbt_end ?>?)</span></p><?rh-cbt_end ?>
<?rh-cbt_start condition="DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_ONLY" ?><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" 
														 style="background-color: #ffffff;">She 
 thinks that the <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">Date 
 of Referral</span> is carried over from WMS to ASSETS (i.e. it is auto-populated 
 in ASSETS). <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">She is double-checking 
 on this.</span></p><?rh-cbt_end ?>
<?rh-cbt_start condition="DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_ONLY" ?><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" 
														 style="background-color: #ffffff;">So, 
 if the case is built through Referral Search, the Date of Referral would 
 be carried over/imported from WMS?</p><?rh-cbt_end ?>
<?rh-cbt_start condition="DEVELOPMENT_SERVER_ONLY" ?><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" 
														 style="background-color: #ffffff;">And, 
 if the case is first built as a Non-TA case and then the CAN# is added 
 later (which converts it to a TA case?), the Date of Referral is the date 
 that the CSEU worker added the CAN# to the case record?</p><?rh-cbt_end ?>
