 &quot;Safety Concerns.&quot;</span><?rh-cbt_end ?></p><?rh-cbt_end ?>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The worker must advise the customer 
 of:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The customer's right 
		 to request address confidentiality from Family Court. &#160;</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The CSEUâ€™s ability 
		 to suppress personally identifying information, such as the customer's 
		 residential address, on documents to be filed with the court and 
		 on other documents that pertain to the child support case.</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If a customer wants services but 
 is afraid for his or her safety, the CSEU can work with the him or her 
 in the following ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
	<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 27px;">Remove 
		 the customer's location and/or employment information from petitions, 
		 notices, or any required financial disclosure, subject to approval 
		 of the court. </p></li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 107px;">(Note: 
 While a customer's address can be suppressed from all forms, it is not 
 always possible to suppress the name of the county CSEU or the court that 
 issued the order.)</p>
<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
	<ol start="2" style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 27px;">Request 
		 that the court not disclose location or employment information 
		 about the customer</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 27px;">Request 
		 that any court-ordered laboratory appointments (for genetic testing, 
		 for example) be scheduled for separate dates for the CP and the 
		 NCP.</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 27px;">File 
		 paternity and support petitions on behalf of customer without 
		 requiring the customer to appear in court with the alleged abuser, 
		 or, if testimony of customer is required, request that the court 
		 make adequate provision for the customer's safety while in court</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="margin-left: 27px;">Provide 
		 all enforcement services without involvement of the customer</p></li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">After receiving this information, 
 and a discussion of the safety concerns, the customer wishes to apply 
 for child support services, he or she must complete and sign the LDSS-4882.
