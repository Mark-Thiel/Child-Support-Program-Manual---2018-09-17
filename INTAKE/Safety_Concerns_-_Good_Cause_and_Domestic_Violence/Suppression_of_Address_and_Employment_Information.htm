<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The CSEU 
 must ensure that the customer's address and employment information do 
 not appear on any documents, notices, summons, 
 etc. that are created by the CSEU as part of providing a CSEU service. 
 SSDs should follow local protocols with regard to listing a substitute 
 address for the customer on ASSETS.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If the customer chooses to request 
 address confidentiality from the Family 
 Court, the CSEU should generate the <span class="Notices_name"><a 
	 title="Address Confidentiality Affidavit" href="http://www.nycourts.gov/forms/familycourt/pdfs/gf-21.pdf" 
	 target="_blank">Address Confidentiality Affidavit</a></span>, which 
 is available on ASSETS as a template in the State Folder of the <span 
	 class="Screen_Name">Local Correspondence tab</span> in the <span class="Screen_Name">Document 
 Generation</span> module.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Alternatively, the customer may 
 complete <span class="Notices_name">Family Court General Form 21 (GF-21),</span> 
 <span class="Notices_name"><a title="Address Confidentiality Affidavit" 
								 href="http://www.nycourts.gov/forms/familycourt/pdfs/gf-21.pdf">Address 
 Confidentiality Affidavit</a></span>, which is available at <a title="New York Courts website" 
	 href="http://www.nycourts.gov" target="_blank">www.nycourts.gov</a>.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The <span class="Notices_name"><a 
	 title="Address Confidentiality Affidavit" href="http://www.nycourts.gov/forms/familycourt/pdfs/gf-21.pdf" 
	 target="_blank">Address Confidentiality Affidavit</a> </span>must 
 be filed with the Family Court. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">If the request for confidentiality 
 is accepted, the Family Court will issue <span class="Notices_name">Family 
 Court General Form 21a</span> (GF-21a), an <span class="Notices_name"><a 
	 title="Address Confidentiality Order" href="http://www.nycourts.gov/forms/familycourt/pdfs/gf-21a.pdf" 
	 target="_blank">Address Confidentiality Order</a>. &#160;</span>&#160;The
