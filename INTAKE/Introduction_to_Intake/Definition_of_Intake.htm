<h1>Introduction to Intake</h1>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers" style="text-align: center;">Cases 
 must be built within <span style="font-weight: bold;">20 calendar days</span> 
 of the CSEU receiving a signed application or referral.</p>
<h2>Definition of Intake</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">&quot;Intake&quot; refers to a 
 group of activities associated with the opening of a child support case.<span 
	 style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&#160;</span>&#160;At a minimum, these 
 activities include:</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
	<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Processing applications 
		 and referrals;</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Establishing a case 
		 record on ASSETS as soon as possible, and within <span style="font-weight: bold;">20 
		 calendar days</span> of receiving an application or referral;</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Initiating system 
		 searches; and</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Routing the case for 
		 the next appropriate case action.</p></li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<h2>Why is the Intake process important?</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The Intake process is an opportunity 
 to gather as much information as possible and to enter it into the case 
 record. The more information that can be gathered during the intake process, 
 the easier it will be to build the case, locate the Respondent, and establish 
 paternity.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Also, the intake interview, whether 
 conducted face-to-face or by telephone, may be the only time that the 
 worker has any personal interaction with the applicant.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">A clean and complete dataset will 
 enable ASSETS to carry out many functions <span style="font-weight: bold; 
												 font-style: italic;">automatically</span> 
 -- that is, to recognize when action is needed, and then to either take 
 action on its own or notify the worker of a need to take action. </p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">But automated processes carried 
 out by the ASSETS system depend upon specific pieces of data or information 
 being found in specific datafields within the case record. If information 
 is missing from the case or account record, or is inaccurate, automated 
 processes may not proceed as they should <?rh-symbol_start name="Em Dash" ?>â€”<?rh-symbol_end ?> 
 or at all. This would cause adverse effects for the customer; adverse 
 effects on performance measures for New York State as a whole and for 
 the individual district in question, and additional work for CSEU workers 
 downstream in the process.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Therefore, it is important for 
 a customer to fill out the <span class="Notices_name"><a title="LDSS-4882 - Information about Child Support Services and Application/Referral for Child Support Services" 
															 href="http://otda.state.nyenet/assets/pages/PDFs/Child_Support_Application/LDSS-4882W.pdf?rhtocid=_10_1_6#bc-1" 
															 target="_blank">LDSS-4882</a></span> 
 as completely and accurately as possible, and for the worker to provide 
 ASSETS with as much information as possible when initially building the 
 case. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Doing so will 
 help with all other aspects of managing that case, for the duration of 
 the case.</span></p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Crucial to accuracy of the performance 
 measures reported to the federal government (including Congress) is proper 
 classification of case types:</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
	<ul style="list-style: disc;">
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">TA</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">IV-E Foster Care</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Non-IV-E Foster Care</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Safety Net</p></li>
		<li><p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Child Support Services 
		 Application (Non-TANF)</p></li>
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Why are performance measures important?</h2>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">The day-to-day actions of child 
 support workers throughout the state have a direct, positive human impact 
 on a multitude of children and parents, and therefore on society as a 
 whole. </p>

 local offices with metrics regarding how well they are serving families 
 and how cost effective their operations are. This information helps state 
 and local offices to maintain quality assurance and pursue quality improvement.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Also, at the federal level, states 
 with better performance measures receive a bigger portion of federal funding.
