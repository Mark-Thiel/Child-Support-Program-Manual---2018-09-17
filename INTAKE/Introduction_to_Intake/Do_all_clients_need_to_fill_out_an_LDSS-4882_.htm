<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">In some districts, applications 
 are filled out on ASSETS by the worker during the intake interview. In 
 those instances, the required signature can be captured using an electronic 
 signature pad, or the worker can print out the completed application and 
 have the applicant sign it.</p>
<p class="Normal_Pre-Bullet_Pre-Numbers">Regardless of how the signature 
 is captured, the page bearing the signed request for services must be 
 kept on file, and must be readily available at any time in the event of 
 an audit.</p>
